# Cartpole-Control-Theory-Algorithms
A library to run seminal algorithms in Optimal Control Theory (LQR, ILQR, and MPC) on the cartpole dynamical system

NOTE: I just re-started activity on this github account and recently uploaded this project. Over the next week or two, I'll be re-organizing and modifing this repository to be more coherent/useful. Ideally, I would like this to be a teaching tool to help people new to control theory understand/visualize the intuition behind key algorithms within the field.
